It seems like you are trying to access a webpage that is restricted, and I don't have the capability to access external web pages directly. However, if you provide me with the text information from that webpage or any other source, I can help you extract and format the pricing information and catalogue details in a structured dictionary format.

Here is an example of how such a dictionary might look if you provide the details:

```python
pricing_information = {
    "products": {
        "Product A": {
            "price": "$100",
            "features": ["Feature 1", "Feature 2", "Feature 3"]
        },
        "Product B": {
            "price": "$200",
            "features": ["Feature 1", "Feature 2", "Feature 4"]
        }
    },
    "comparisons": [
        {
            "feature": "Feature 1",
            "Product A": True,
            "Product B": True
        },
        {
            "feature": "Feature 2",
            "Product A": True,
            "Product B": True
        },
        {
            "feature": "Feature 3",
            "Product A": True,
            "Product B": False
        },
        {
            "feature": "Feature 4",
            "Product A": False,
            "Product B": True
        }
    ]
}

print(pricing_information)
```

Please provide the necessary details, and I will help you organize them!
